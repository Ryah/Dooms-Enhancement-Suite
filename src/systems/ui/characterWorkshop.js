/**
 * Character Workshop — per-character editor + scene injector.
 *
 * Scope: Identity (read-only) and Appearance (portrait + dialogue color).
 * Plus an "Inject into Scene" action that (a) adds the character to the
 * active known-characters roster so they appear on the portrait bar,
 * and (b) queues a one-shot SillyTavern extension prompt instructing
 * the AI to bring the character into the scene on the next turn. The
 * injection is cleared automatically once generation ends.
 *
 * Opening is decoupled from portraitBar.js via a window CustomEvent
 * ('dooms:open-workshop') so portraitBar does not import this module.
